# FAQ

### Who are you?
I'm Shin, also known as Kayli depending on when you met me. I go by both.

### What did you study?
I studied computer science, economics, and [mathematical methods and social sciences (MMSS)](https://www.mmss.northwestern.edu/people/students/class-of-2018.html) at Northwestern University. Go wildcats!

### What do you do?
I'm a Solution Engineer at Google in Google Ads. I used to be a Software Engineer at Accenture. Prior, I interned at Cisco as a Software Engineer, at Evolve Digital Labs as a Data Analyst, and at GOOD Worldwide Inc in Business Partnership.

### Where did you do research at in undergrad?
Northwestern's School of Communication, Kellogg School of Management, and School of Education & Social Policy. I wrote my [senior thesis on Facebook News Trends](https://github.com/shinandruth/facebookTrends) under the mentorship of Prof. Nicholas Diakopoulos.

### Why do you have such a diverse work/education background?
Prior to college, I wanted to go into business. By the end of my first year, I narrowed it down to investment banking. By the beginning of my third year, I completely changed paths, added computer science as a major, and selected software engineering. When selecting my first full-time job, I wanted to combine both my engineering and business background so I joined Accenture as a client-facing software engineer. After a year, I joined big tech because though consulting is fun, I didn't feel a sparkle.  

### Where do you see yourself in the future?
Maybe at someone's startup. Maybe at my own startup. Regardless of where, happy & enjoying what I do while making others happy along the way.

### What do you enjoy?
I find happiness in a lot of things, big and small. I particularly enjoy walks w/ friend(s) or an audiobook, roadtrips/travels, giving gifts to loved ones, trying anything I never done before, and learning about/from people. 


# Fun Facts

* I was the only student in my MMSS class to get paid to write my senior thesis. I used that extra cash to travel to Disney World for 4 days.  
* My mom was not a fan of driving me to my lessons/activites so much that my parents gifted me a car before I got my license. Don't worry, I had a permit at least. And no, I never got caught. I still have this car a decade later. Thanks mom!
